- Some vehicles in a car fleet may drive by close routes to each other (near similar locations at similar time).
- How much ride duplication (or extra travel costs) does the fleet owner face with per day or per week?
- `rider` package provdes a toolkit for these estimates given the car tracks provided.
- Finding some ride duplication is a good excercise before working on any *travel optimisation* problems.
