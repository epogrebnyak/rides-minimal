- Some vehicles in a car fleet went by *close routes* to each other (similar locations, similar time)? 
- Let's find out how much *ride duplication* (extra travel costs) we have per day or week.
- This is a good estimate to have before working on any *travel optimisation*.

See [documentation](https://epogrebnyak.github.io/rides-minimal) (in Russian).
